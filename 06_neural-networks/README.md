# CI Stage: Image Classification with Neural Networks

<p align="center"><img src="pipeline.svg" alt="The Drip Detector CI-pipeline with Classifying with a CNN highlighted" width="760"></p>

## Why?

📍 **Where we are:** Processing, stage 6: **Classifying**, with a convolutional neural network running next to the forest.
On the layer diagram: Natural Scene → Digital Data → Preparing for Analysis → **Model Training** → Inference.

The forest only sees what we told it to look at in stage 5. A convolutional neural network learns its own filters, straight from the segmented pixels.

Both run in the same pipeline, so every run is a head-to-head. Out of the box, on 360 frames, the network loses (about 79 % against 97 %). Why, and what it would take to win, is this week's lesson: data, overfitting, and why graphics cards changed everything.

**Without this stage:** we never find out whether the modern approach is actually better for *our* product.
